<h1>Tenable-Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Welcome to my Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Management Lab project on GitHub! As a cybersecurity aficionado, I've crafted this hands-on learning experience tailored to enthusiasts like myself. Through the power of virtual machines (VMs), I've created a sandbox environment that mirrors real-world scenarios, enabling me to delve deep into vulnerability assessment and management using Tenable Nessus.
<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
- <b>Oracle VM Virtual Box Manager</b>

<h2>Achievement</h2>

- <b>Setup of Sandbox Environment:
Successfully identified hardware and software requirements for VMs.
Installed VMware Workstation on the host machine to create a virtualization platform.
Created VMs including one for 
Nessus scanner Host :  Window 10 and the
Target systems : Kali Linux
</b>

- <b>Networking Configuration:
Configured networking settings to allow communication between VM.
Established network connectivity for the Nessus scanner VM window 10 (ping on command prompt to confirm communication with target). Target systems (IP: 10.0.2.15)
</b>

- <b>Installation and Configuration of Nessus on Window 10:
Downloaded and installed the Nessus software package from the Tenable website.
Activated Nessus using the provided license key.
Configured Nessus settings including scan policies, target hosts, and scan schedules.
</b>

- <b>Vulnerability Scans:
Conducted vulnerability scans using Nessus, targeting kali Linux systems in the sandbox environment.
Created custom scan policies to tailor scans based on specific requirements.
Monitored scan progress and managed scan results through the Nessus web interface.
</b>

- <b>Analyzed scan results to identify vulnerabilities detected on target systems.
Prioritized vulnerabilities based on severity ratings and potential impact on security.
</b>

- <b>Remediation of Vulnerabilities:
Developed and implemented a plan to address identified vulnerabilities.
Applied patches, configuration changes, and other mitigation measures to resolve vulnerabilities.
Improved the overall security posture of the systems by remediating vulnerabilities effectively.
